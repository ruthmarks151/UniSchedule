A smarter way to plan your university course schedule.

To use this script download the zip file and extract it.

Edit courses.txt so it has your course info in the same format.
It will have lines based on the course and what block it's in.
The line after that has all the available sections copied from SOLAR.
Edit prefs.csv based on when you want to avoid classes.
You can use any scale you like, and even negative numbers.
Run Unischedule.py it may take a while to run.
